well , you let go of 1 / 7 of the workforce , so the total number of workers went down . the remaining workers are still 1 / 7 of the initial workers , but the group has changed . the new workforce is smaller than the original group , specifically 6 / 7 of it because 1 / 7 was eliminated . the remaining workers now account for 1 / 7 out of 6 / 7 of the force , which if we multiply by 7 gives us 1 out of 6 . this number as a percentage is answer choice b , 49.67 % . using the absolute numbers we calculated before , there were 4,060 journeymen employees out of 14,210 total . if 2,030 of them are laid off , then there are 2,030 journeyman employees left , but now out of a total of ( 14,210 - 2,030 ) 12,180 employees . 2,030 / 12,180 is exactly 1 / 6 , or 16.67 % . the answer will work with either percentages or absolute numbers , but the percentage calculation will be significantly faster and applicable to any similar situation . the underlying principle of percentages ( and , on a related note , ratios ) can be summed up in the brainteaser i like to ask my students : if you \u2019 re running a race and you overtake the 2 nd place runner just before the end , what position do you end up in ? the correct answer is 2 nd place . percentages , like ratios and other concepts of relative math , depend entirely on the context . whether 100 % more of something is better than 50 % more of something else depends on the context much more than the percentages quoted . when it comes to percentages on the gmat , the goal is to understand them enough to instinctively not fall into the traps laid out for you . e", "answer": 49.99999999999999, "task_id": 1017}, {"text": "# if jimmy drinks 8 ounces of water each time for 8 times a day . how much gallons of water he would have to prepare ahead to drink for 5 days ?
